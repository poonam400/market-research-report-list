**üì° What is an Active Optical Network?**

An Active Optical Network (AON) is a point-to-point fiber-optic
communication system that uses electrically powered equipment such as
switches and routers to manage signal distribution. Unlike passive
systems, AONs offer more flexibility, better bandwidth allocation, and
real-time network management, making them ideal for modern digital
needs.
